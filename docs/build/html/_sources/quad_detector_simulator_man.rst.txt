quad_detector_simulator
========================

Don't you wish you knew how quadrature detectors worked? In principle, it works by splitting the analog signal into two initially identical channels: the real and imaginary. Both channels get multiplied by an AC signal at the demodulation frequency but the AC signal for each channel differs by pi/2 radians. The channels are then filtered to remove high frequency components. After the filter the data is discretely sampled and that data is averaged over some sampling period: the dwell time.
